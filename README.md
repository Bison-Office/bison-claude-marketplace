# Contributing

Our plugin system makes it easy to share Claude skills, commands, hooks, and agents with the whole team. Each plugin is fully independent and completely optional, so you’re free to build your own personal plugins without worrying about impacting others. If a plugin becomes popular, we may eventually make it a default for our teams.

We’d love to see more examples, experiments, and ideas—so feel free to create and share your own plugins!

In the future, we’ll introduce a more structured approach to maintaining plugins in this repository. For now: explore, try things out, and have fun.
